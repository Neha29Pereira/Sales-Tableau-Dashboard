# Sales-Tableau-Dashboard
# Overview
In today's competitive world, data is the new lifeline of business intelligence. However, understanding the relationship between sales, profit, and product performance can be a bit difficult for retailers and business owners. This project aims to cover that gap through a comprehensive Sales Dashboard powered by a rich dataset from a Superstore.
Our goal is to provide important insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using visual analytics and statistical breakdowns. This will help businesses make data-driven decisions, refine their strategies, and ultimately enhance profitability.
The dataset used in this project represents transactional and demographic data from a Superstore. Each row corresponds to a unique product within an order and contains details like customer information, product details, financial metrics, and shipping logistics.
